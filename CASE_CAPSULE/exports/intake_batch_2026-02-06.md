# Intake Batch — 2026-02-06

## Scope
This batch captures user-provided transcriptions and statements into structured intake form for later verification.

## Added/Referenced Artifacts
- Corporate filings references for Savatara (incorporation, officer changes, status active).
- Program credit references (2021 Nutcracker attribution vs. 2025 omission context).
- Public property record references for 21 Irmgard LA.
- Text-message references (overwork, threat language, scheduling pressure, creative-asset coordination).
- Email reference (DFR termination notice using reliability framing).
- Attribution note: Valerie credited Allison as contributor/author in early Bardavon works following “Altered Allegro” (user statement).

## Device-loss Provenance Note
Several records are secondary captures (photographed screen content) due to primary device loss. Preserve original photos unchanged and track origin metadata in ledger entries.

## Neutral Processing Rules
1. Record what is visible/on-screen.
2. Separate transcription from legal conclusion.
3. Mark unknown dates as `UNKNOWN` until independently verified.
4. Keep append-only IDs and add new entries without rewriting prior evidence rows.

## Next Verification Steps
- Export full iMessage threads where available.
- Obtain source PDFs for public corporate/property records.
- Save complete email with headers for termination and work directives.
- Attach any bank/broker statements tied to pending references (PENDING-REF-001/002/003).
