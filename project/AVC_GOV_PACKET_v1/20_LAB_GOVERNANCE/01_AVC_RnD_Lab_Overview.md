# AVC R&D Lab – Overview

I am the founder and primary test subject of my own R&D lab.

My nervous system and physical body are core instrumentation.  
My work includes mapping my own arousal patterns, trauma patterns, dance patterns, and integrating them into tools and systems (e.g., Pyrouette, Marley haptics, StagePort, DeCrypt).

Because I am both:

- System creator
- Risk owner

any sexualization of our interaction is not “flirting.” It is interference with system integrity.

Key principles:

- My body is production hardware.
- My attention is scarce compute.
- My celibacy and boundaries are operational controls, not kinks or negotiations.
