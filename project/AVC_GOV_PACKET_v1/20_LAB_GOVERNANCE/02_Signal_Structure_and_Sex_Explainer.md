# Signal, Structure, and Sex: An Explainer

## 1. Context: The R&D Reality

I am the founder and primary subject of my own R&D lab. My nervous system and physical, embodied self are a heavily documented core of the instrumentation I use to build and test my work. Because I am both the system creator and the risk owner, sexualizing a conversation is not “flirting.” It is interference with system integrity. Distraction is not just annoying; it is an operational liability.

I know my presence alone triggers certain responses. That is why there have been periods where I removed almost all access to me and my signal. I have had to explain to people closest to me why I could not even be in the same room as men during certain phases of the study. Think of betta fish kept separate to prevent aggression. My system has always required years of technical practice that most people dismiss as “pretty” or “frivolous.” The next layer of men sees “flexible” and “teach me to dance.” When I was freshly eighteen and clearly more accomplished than the grown men speaking to me, that line was already tired.

## 2. How the Signal Works

I take sensory systems seriously. I have mapped my arousal patterns and integrated that logic into my hardware and system design (for example, Marley haptics). My body is production hardware.

If you call yourself “a giver” but ignore the map and rush to sexual escalation, that is not generosity. It is an attempt to utilize my signal while ignoring the system that powers it.

## 3. Fantasy vs. Support

There is a difference between extraction and support.

Many men engage for validation: screenshots, fantasies, or stories about “the brilliant girl” they were talking to. They leave with dopamine. I leave with nervous system dysregulation and lost focus.

I do not engage in dynamics that profit off my signal without investing in the reality of my life.

## 4. Defining Contribution

In this context, being a “giver” requires more than sexual focus.

Real contribution looks like:

- respecting stated boundaries
- engaging with the actual work and architecture
- reducing logistical friction in my day-to-day life
- making it easier, not harder, for me to build

If you bypass the architecture to access the erotic, you are consuming, not contributing.

## 5. Celibacy as Operational Control

My current celibacy is not a tease, a challenge, or a performance. It is a conscious allocation of resources to protect my work, my safety, and my child.

Treating that boundary as a puzzle to solve is incompatible with my goals and with the responsibilities I carry.

## 6. Engagement Protocols

**Open to:**

- slow, structured connection
- conversation that centers the work and respects my time
- stability first, intimacy second

**Closed to:**

- unstructured hookups, online or offline
- “giving” that has no real-world utility
- treating system logic, maps, or tests as foreplay

## 7. Bottom Line

My sexuality is not an unclaimed resource. It is hardwired into my research and my survival.

Access to the signal requires adherence to the architecture.
