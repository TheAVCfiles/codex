# Dating Terms of Service – AVC

By engaging romantically or sexually with me, you implicitly agree to:

1. Respect my time, work, and child as primary commitments.
2. Accept that my nervous system is instrumentation, not entertainment.
3. Treat “distracting” and “overwhelming” as hard stop signals, not invitations to negotiate.
4. Understand that celibacy is an operational choice, not a puzzle to solve.
5. Acknowledge that access can be reduced or revoked without debate if my system is harmed.

Violation of these terms may result in immediate loss of access.
