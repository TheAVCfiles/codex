# Never Again Protocol

Goal:
Stop subsidizing men’s fantasies and ego at the expense of my work, lineage, and nervous system.

Components:

1. Sentient Cents Scorecard

   - Structural Contribution (0–5)
   - Emotional Regulation (0–5)
   - Boundary Intelligence (0–5)
   - Signal Literacy (0–5)
   - 0–7: Noise, 8–12: NPC, 13–16: Ally, 17–20: Architect Candidate.

2. Shitbag Tax

   - Any interaction that leaves me drained, confused, or derailed triggers:
     - Level 1: Distance
     - Level 2: Downgrade
     - Level 3: Account Closure

3. Tiered Access
   - Tier 0: Spectator
   - Tier 1: Ally
   - Tier 2: Architect in Testing
   - Tier 3: Partner / Husband Lane (after sustained net-positive performance across real life stressors).

Rule:
Promote slowly, demote fast. Access is earned, not begged for, and once lost, it is hard to regain.
