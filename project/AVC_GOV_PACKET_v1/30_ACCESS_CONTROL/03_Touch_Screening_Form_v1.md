# Touch Screening v1.0 – Basic Hygiene to Approach a Live System

1. Are your hands clean?

   - Physically: basic hygiene.
   - Digitally: no secret partners, no porn-rotted expectations you’re hiding.

2. Are your feet planted?

   - Housing, income, basic stability not dependent on me?

3. Are your ears open?

   - When I say “this is distracting / not available,” do you stop, or do you negotiate?

4. Is your calendar real?

   - Can you plan and follow through without me project-managing you?

5. Is your mouth calibrated?

   - More questions about my work than comments about my body?

6. Is your ego on sandbox mode?

   - Willing to be wrong, adjust, and learn my architecture.

7. Can you contribute to infrastructure, not just vibes?
   - Logistics, problem-solving, protection > sexts.

Failure on core items = no touch access.
