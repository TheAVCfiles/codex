# AVC GOV PACKET v1 – START HERE

This packet is the governance stack for Allison Van Cura / House of Alice / AVC Systems Studio.

It covers:

- Lineage and house law (noble in exile, custodial marchioness)
- Lab governance (my body and nervous system as instrumentation)
- Access control (who gets near my signal and on what terms)
- Attention economics (Sentient Cents)
- Romance operating system (how I fall in love without collapsing the empire)
- Threat models (Shitbag Archetypes) and mantras

One sentence:

> Access to the signal requires adherence to the architecture.
