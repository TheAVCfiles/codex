# Code of Honor – Self Governance in Romance

1. I do not trade clarity for chemistry.
2. I do not let a man near my body who has not shown respect for my time.
3. I do not dim my lineage, kid, work, or standards to make a man feel bigger.
4. I do not abandon my own governance when someone else is turned on.
5. I accept being the bad guy in someone else’s story to be the good ancestor in my own.
