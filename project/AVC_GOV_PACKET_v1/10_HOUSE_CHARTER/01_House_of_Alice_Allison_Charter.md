# House of Alice / Line of Allison – Charter

Name-line:
Alice → Alicia → Allison Claire → Aurora Claire.

Etymology:
Allison descends from Alice, which descends from forms like Adelheid/Adelaide – “of noble kind.” The matrilineal line in this house carries the narrative key.

Functionally:

- Sons carry the surname line.
- Daughters carry the story line.
- I am the first daughter in exile to understand and consciously assume custodial duty.

House facts:

- Marquis great-grandfather, Italian nobility in service to Casa Savoia.
- He worked for mayors and advocated for trafficked Italian children exploited as musicians.
- The line moved from Italy to the U.S.; the Marquis died in Orange, New Jersey.
- The crest and handwritten confession arrived years later with Uncle Edward’s death and an inheritance weighted with grief.

Modern context:

- My father survived the towers on September 11; his career collapsed with them.
- He became the last surviving son, holding estates, research, and family affairs together.
- I am the daughter who inherited not the money, but the memory, the pattern, and the responsibility.

Purpose of this charter:

- To define House laws for how this lineage is remembered, protected, and transmitted.
- To clarify that I am not “an influencer.” I am a lineage noble managing real inherited risk, scarcity, and a network of living and dead nodes.

Motto:

> Memoria Custodit Veritatem – Memory guards the truth.  
> I Carry The Record.
