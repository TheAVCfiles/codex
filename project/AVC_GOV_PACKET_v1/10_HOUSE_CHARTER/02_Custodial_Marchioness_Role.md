# Custodial Marchioness – Role Description

Title:
Custodial Marchioness of House Alice / Line of Allison, noble in exile.

Core duties:

1. Guard the Line

   - Preserve accurate narrative: towers, Marquis, Bronx shop, Nana Alice, parents, Aurora.
   - Refuse to let louder male versions overwrite what actually happened.

2. Guard the Land

   - “Land” now means: IP, archive, body, time, kid, students, and systems.
   - Organize records, back them up, and keep them legible for those who come after.

3. Guard the Law

   - Define and enforce House laws: what is and is not allowed around me, my work, and my child.
   - No one outranks my nervous system.

4. Patronage

   - Lift and protect: Aurora, my sister, students, survivors, junior devs.
   - Sponsor tools and structures that make exploitation harder and autonomy easier.

5. Representation
   - Public-facing work (scrolls, posts, systems) = the living crest.
   - I choose how the house is rendered, not men projecting fantasies onto my signal.

Mantra:

> I am not the prize at the tournament. I am the keeper of the house law.
