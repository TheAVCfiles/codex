# Py.rouette v1.0 Protocol Lock (Heart Muscle Spec)

## Purpose

Py.rouette v1.0 defines a single canonical scoring protocol for studio assessment and injury return-to-dance decisions. The protocol standardizes **TES + PCS + GOE**, fixes non-negotiable invariants, and guarantees provenance through the Capture Nerve ingest path.

## Scope (v1.0)

- Input: one recorded phrase, one dancer, one evaluator session.
- Output: scored PDF (`Judge Card` + rubric), machine-readable score JSON, provenance hash.
- Deployment wedge: **Py.rouette Judge Kit** for internal studio assessments.

## Canonical Formula Set

### 1) Technical Element Score (TES)

For each technical element `e`:

`ElementScore(e) = BV(e) + GOE(e)`

Total technical score:

`TES = Σ ElementScore(e), for e in judged_elements`

Where:

- `BV(e)` = base value from the locked element table.
- `GOE(e)` = grade of execution adjustment bounded to the v1.0 scale.

### 2) Program Component Score (PCS)

For each component `c`:

`ComponentScore(c) = Factor(c) × AvgJudgeMark(c)`

Total program score:

`PCS = Σ ComponentScore(c), for c in components`

### 3) Composite Total

`TotalSegmentScore = TES + PCS - Deductions`

## GOE Scale (v1.0)

- Integer band only: `-5` to `+5`.
- `0` = expected execution.
- Positive GOE rewards quality over raw risk.
- Negative GOE captures faults, instability, or unsafe mechanics.

## Invariants (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Deterministic replay:** same inputs produce identical totals.
2. **Bounded GOE:** no value outside `[-5, +5]`.
3. **No silent edits:** every score mutation writes actor, timestamp, and reason.
4. **Hash-sealed outputs:** generated PDF + JSON pair receives digest at completion.
5. **Version pinning:** all artifacts include `protocol_version = pyrouette-v1.0`.
6. **Element table lock:** BV table cannot drift within v1.0 lifecycle.
7. **Single-clock provenance:** capture timestamp comes from ingest event, not manual entry.
8. **Ledger-first persistence:** write to local ledger before any cloud mirror.

## Judge Quick Card v1.0

### Inputs

- Dancer ID
- Session ID
- Phrase / routine ID
- Timestamped recording reference

### Scoring Pass

1. Mark each technical element with BV + GOE.
2. Mark each PCS component on agreed scale.
3. Apply deductions (falls, interruptions, safety events).
4. Confirm auto-calculated totals.

### Outputs

- `judge_card_v1.pdf`
- `score_payload_v1.json`
- `provenance.sha256`

## Comparison Artifact v1.0

A standardized side-by-side report for evaluative review:

- Column A: baseline session
- Column B: current session
- Delta blocks: TES, PCS, deductions, composite total
- Stability flags: improvement / flat / regression
- Provenance block: hashes + capture IDs

## Capture Nerve Integration Contract

Every artifact generated by Py.rouette v1.0 must route through **Pass de Chat** and weekly **Sunday Brunch Rinse** synthesis:

1. Ingest event created (`status=raw`).
2. Artifact hash computed and stored in local-first ledger.
3. Weekly synthesis emits compressed narrative + metrics (`status=synthesized`).
4. Processed archive receives export-ready bundle (`status=archived`).

## Acceptance Criteria (Protocol Lock Complete)

- Formula outputs reproduce across two independent reruns.
- Judge Quick Card can be completed in under 8 minutes per routine.
- Comparison artifact renders from any two valid session payloads.
- All outputs can be zipped in one click with attached provenance manifest.
