# M.O.M. (My Organic Memory)

## North Star

**Your Life, Remembered. The way a mother would.**

M.O.M. is an agentic memory system designed to hold not just facts, but context, emotional weight, and relational meaning. It treats memories as living nodes in a trusted graph so you can recall what matters with the warmth, intuition, and precision of a mother’s mind.

## The Core Analogy: “Calling Mom”

**Why we call Mom to remember:**

- **Implicit Context**: You can ask for “that weird cheese from the wedding,” and she knows which wedding.
- **Emotional Salience**: She knows what _matters_ to you, not just what happened.
- **Associative Recall**: One question sparks three useful connections.
- **Proactive Reminders**: She reaches out before you ask.
- **Trusted & Private**: The information stays safe with her.

M.O.M. is built to operationalize all five pillars.

## Product Promise

M.O.M. is not a note app. It is a living confidant that:

- **Remembers with care**: emotionally weighted memory retrieval, not just keyword search.
- **Connects the dots**: surfaces latent links across time, projects, and people.
- **Protects the sacred**: end‑to‑end encryption with user-held keys.
- **Acts with tact**: proactive nudges that respect boundaries and intent.

## System Architecture: The A‑MEM Spine

M.O.M. is powered by an A‑MEM-inspired architecture that treats every input as a memory primitive in a relational graph.

### 1) Capture

**Natural language, always-on:**

- voice notes
- chat prompts
- forwarded emails
- meeting transcripts
- “think aloud” journaling

### 2) Weave

Every memory becomes a **MemNode** with:

- **Deconstruction** (entities, topics, locations, people)
- **Core Extraction** (the “gist” of the memory)
- **Automatic Linking** (graph edges to related memories)

### 3) Weight

**Emotional Salience Tagging** assigns an importance score using:

- sentiment and tone analysis
- explicit user signals (“this matters to me”)
- recurrence and time sensitivity

### 4) Synthesize

**Proactive synthesis** surfaces:

- daily briefings
- relationship reminders
- pattern alerts (“this mirrors a past project”)
- conflict checks (“you booked two overlapping events”)

## Memory Graph: The Living Archive

M.O.M. maintains a personal knowledge graph where:

- **Nodes** are memories and projects.
- **Edges** encode relational meaning (people, places, emotions, time).
- **Weights** guide relevance and retrieval.
- **Privacy rules** gate visibility and sharing.

This graph is not static—it evolves with you.

## Experience Design

### The Conversational Interface

A minimalist chat UI that feels like a trusted counsel.

### The Memory Graph View

A 3D, explorable constellation of your life’s nodes.

### Project Weaver

“Create a project space for my novel.”
M.O.M. auto‑collects characters, notes, research, and snippets into a living dossier.

### The Guardian

“Are you sure?” warnings prevent conflicts and mistakes, based on your own history.

## Feature Pillars (V1)

1. **Memory Capture** (text + voice)
2. **Relational Graph** with auto‑linking
3. **Emotional Salience** controls (implicit + explicit)
4. **Daily Briefing** with proactive insights
5. **Secure Vault** with user‑held encryption keys

## Trust & Privacy

- **Zero‑knowledge encryption** (you hold the key)
- **Local-first caching** with optional cloud sync
- **Granular memory controls** (visibility, retention, deletion)
- **Redaction mode** for sensitive entries

## Monetization

- **Freemium**: limited nodes + basic linking
- **M.O.M.+**: unlimited memory, deep synthesis, integrations

- **Creatives & academics** who need cross‑domain recall
- **ADHD users** seeking executive function support
- **Anyone overwhelmed by modern memory fragmentation**

## Narrative Positioning

M.O.M. is the memory you always wished you had—warm, trusted, and proactive. It is not just “AI for notes.” It is the emotional intelligence layer on top of your life.

## Next Build Targets

- **Emotional salience model**
- **Daily synthesis engine**
- **Guardian logic** (conflict detection)

## Brand Language

- **Tone**: protective, precise, calm
- **Metaphor**: mother as trusted memory guardian
- **Promise**: “You don’t have to carry it all alone.”

If you want, I can draft **SYSTEM_SPEC_v1.0** (MemNode™, Corridors™, Coda™, StagePort™) as a separate, formal document to lock the structure before any public storytelling.
