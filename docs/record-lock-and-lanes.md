# Record Lock + Audience Split (Template)

## 1) Lock the record

- **Freeze line**: `Frozen as of: YYYY-MM-DD (UTC)`
- Apply this line in:
  - Reader Zero
  - Appendix A
  - Exhibit Index
  - Evidence packet cover pages
- After the freeze:
  - Do not edit existing content
  - Log new material in a separate addendum

## 2) Split audiences

### Lane A — Administrative

**Goal**: clean intake with minimal volume.

- Submit the core packet only:
  - Reader Zero
  - Appendix A
  - Exhibit Index
  - A small, representative exhibit set
- Wait for the agency to request more.

### Lane B — Counsel / Insurance

**Goal**: quiet risk review.

- Provide a separate intake pack that includes:
  - The same core packet
  - Counsel-facing summary
  - A short licensing offer (if applicable)
- Avoid narrative or argument.

## 3) Public-record consistency table

Use this table to align public snapshots with internal evidence.

| Date       | Platform      | Used element     | Source           |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 2020-06-14 | Website       | Program language | Wayback snapshot |
| 2021-01-09 | Instagram bio | Title/name       | IG archive       |
| 2022-04-22 | Landing page  | Offer structure  | Wayback snapshot |
| 2023-02-10 | Website       | Same system      | Wayback snapshot |

## 4) Guardrails (do not do)

- Do not contact the other party directly.
- Do not post the packet publicly.
- Do not expand theories after the freeze.
- Do not add commentary inside evidence files.

## 5) Neutral cover sentence

> “I’m not asserting intent. I’m aligning dates.”
