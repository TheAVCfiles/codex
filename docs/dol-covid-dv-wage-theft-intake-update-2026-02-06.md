## Immediate Packet Routing (DOL/COVID + DV)

1. **NY DOL packet:** include rows `001-003` as control/supervision indicators.
2. **CT DOL packet:** mirror `002-003` for CT-linked work direction and pricing hierarchy.
3. **NY OVS economic-loss narrative:** include `001` to anchor unemployment/displacement timing during DV-era instability.
4. **Hashing step:** compute SHA-256 for each original image file and replace `TO_COMPUTE` before submission.

## Chain-of-Custody Checklist (same day)

- Export original screenshots from device without recompression where possible.
- Preserve original filenames and acquisition date in an exhibit log.
- Compute and record SHA-256 per file.
- Store a read-only copy in an archive folder and a working copy for redactions.

## Redaction Guidance (before filing)

- Redact non-essential phone numbers and any unrelated third-party identifiers.
- Keep timestamps, sender labels, and message body text visible.
- Do not crop out context that establishes sequence/order.
