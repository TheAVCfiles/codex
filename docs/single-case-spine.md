# Single Case Spine — Evidence-First Base (NY/CT COVID‑Era, DV Context)

**Purpose (not legal advice)**  
Create a single, coherent case backbone that stays **artifact‑anchored** and **non‑speculative**. This spine is the map that all evidence, timelines, and claims attach to.

---

## 1) Identity + Parties (facts only)

**Claimant:**  
**Respondents / Entities:**  
**Known aliases / name variants:**  
**Jurisdictions:** NY / CT  
**Primary work period (reported):**  
**Primary work locations (reported):**

> Keep this section factual and tied to documentary evidence (ID records, entity filings, contracts, or verified emails).

---

## 2) Case Objective (one sentence)

> Example: “Establish unpaid labor, misclassification, and IP reuse during COVID‑era work, supported by verified schedules, messages, and production artifacts.”

---

## 3) Evidence‑First Timeline (C1/C2 only)

> Each entry must link to a concrete artifact. If an entry can’t be verified, move it to Section 4.

| Row ID | Date (ISO) | Event (factual) | Evidence Location | Proof ID | Verification |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------------ |

---

## 4) Reported Events (C0 — awaiting artifact)

| Row ID | Reported Date Range | Reported Event | Needed Artifact(s) | Status |
| ------ | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------ |

---

## 5) Work & Compensation Spine

**Known Rate Evidence (C1/C2 only):**  
**Known Pay Evidence (C1/C2 only):**  
**Unpaid Work Evidence (C1/C2 only):**

> Use the wage reconstruction method from the fast dossier to avoid over‑claiming.

---

## 6) IP / Curriculum / Choreography Spine

**Original Assets (proof of origin):**  
**Public Use Evidence (if any):**  
**Match Strength (C0/C1/C2):**

> Populate the DFER Public Use Comparison Grid only after proof of origin and use are verified.

---

## 7) Relief Path Mapping (fastest‑first)

1. **NY OVS + NY DOL** (fastest money path)
2. **CT DOL** (parallel)
3. **IRS identity‑theft workflow** (only after mismatch evidence)

> Use privacy‑safe filing practices (county/city only; confidential address status).

---

## 8) Evidence Intake Checklist (operational)

- [ ] Stage evidence into `/data/forensics/originals/`.
- [ ] Hash and inventory files.
- [ ] Add rows to `data/forensic_evidence_summary.csv`.
- [ ] Move items from Section 4 → Section 3 only after artifacts are attached (C1/C2).

**Status:** Spine ready. Add artifacts first, then build claims.
