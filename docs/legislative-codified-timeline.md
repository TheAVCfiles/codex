# Legislative-Codified Timeline (Evidence-First, Linear)

This timeline is **linear, evidence-first, and codified**. Every row must link to a concrete artifact before it is promoted to Proven. Use this to preserve screenshots and align them to a lawful, non‑speculative record.

## How to use

- **Reported (C0)**: listed to preserve context; do not treat as factual until an artifact is attached.
- **Proven (C1/C2)**: requires an artifact saved under `data/forensics/` and logged in `data/forensic_evidence_summary.csv`.
- **Codification**: each event gets a stable **Event Code** for cross‑reference in memos and exhibits.

## Linear timeline (Proven)

| Event Code | Date (ISO) | Time (local) | Location | Event Summary (fact-only) | Artifact / Evidence Location | Proof ID | Verification Status | Notes |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ----- |

## Linear timeline (Reported / Awaiting Artifact)

| Event Code | Reported Date Range | Location | Reported Summary | Needed Artifact(s) | Status | Notes |
| ---------- | ------------------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------ | ----- |

## Screenshot preservation checklist

- [ ] Save each screenshot under `data/forensics/messages/` with a stable filename.
- [ ] Add a row per screenshot to `data/forensic_evidence_summary.csv`.
- [ ] Record the on‑screen date/time and participant name in the timeline row.
- [ ] Promote from Reported → Proven only after the artifact is logged.

## Event code format

Use `EVT-YYYYMMDD-###` (e.g., `EVT-20210722-001`).

## Codified timeline notes

- Keep summaries **fact‑only** (no interpretation).
- If multiple artifacts corroborate the same event, mark **C2** and list all proof IDs.
- Use this timeline to anchor later **DFR/DFER public‑use comparisons** without overclaiming.
