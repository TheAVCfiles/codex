# Custodial R&D Operations Manual: Intuition Labs

## A Framework for Sovereign, High-Ticket IP Development

**Objective:** Replace unpredictable, extractive labor with a structured, profitable custodial R&D lab that achieves financial sovereignty by licensing proprietary constraint systems.

## I. Business Model & Strategy: The Arbitrage Thesis (Enhanced)

The model shifts from hourly consultation to high-leverage IP/SaaS revenue via two primary pathways: high-ticket licensing and scalable arbitrage.

| Element              | Definition                                                                                                                                               | Profit Pathway                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product**          | **Constraint (The Brakes):** Proprietary operators (\(\mathcal{G}\) Operator, Mercy Gate) that reduce risk and prevent failure in autonomous systems.    | Selling scarcity through high-ticket IP licensing for core operators (\$250K+ annual fee per client).                                                                               |
| **Market Arbitrage** | **Annotation Arbitrage:** Profit from the difference between commodity labor costs and the high value of certified data integrity (kinematic coherence). | SaaS/Service with tiered platform access fees (\$3K–\$12K/mo) plus high per-unit processing fees (\$1.50–\$10.00) for complex scoring.                                              |
| **Foundational IP**  | **MythOS Local Foundation:** A self-hosted, local-first R&D environment.                                                                                 | **Anti-Extractive Edge:** Proves the lab’s data integrity and security, attracting clients concerned about SaaS lock-in while avoiding the “sacrificial burn rate” of grant cycles. |

## II. WFH Operational Cadence: The Choreography of R&D (Enhanced)

The rhythm of the lab mirrors ballet training, moving from deep work to auditable proofing and high-signal deployment.

| Choreography Phase          | R&D Operational Task                                                                                                                                                                       | Tools & Metrics                                                                                                                    | Boundary Defense                                                                                                                   |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PRACTICE (Deep Work)**    | IP/Code Creation: Write the next white paper section or refine the \(\mathcal{G}\) Operator code.                                                                                          | MythOS `server.py` (local API). **A(t) Metric** (Authenticity Index) must run daily before starting.                               | **Zero interruption.** Treat as a studio rehearsal and screen all calls.                                                           |
| **STAGING (Testing)**       | Local provenance and debugging: run the Glissé Engine or Graham Glitch Engine against edge cases on the local server. Test the Mercy Gate (\(\sigma \ge \epsilon\)).                       | Graham Glitch Engine or Jupyter notebooks. **Goal:** verify integrity with local SHA256 hashes.                                    | **Verify integrity:** generate a verifiable **Proof Tag** (JSON/Markdown). Never send raw code—share only the certified Proof Tag. |
| **THEATRE TECH (Proofing)** | Metric generation and archiving: execute the final proof report (e.g., the **-0.63** correlation check). Hash and timestamp all finalized artifacts, then append to the Provenance Ledger. | Provenance Ledger (**A(t)** metric). **Output goal:** four major Proof Tags (JSON) per year.                                       | Close the loop: no new creative work. Verify the trace and auditability.                                                           |
| **SHOW (Implementation)**   | Licensing and outreach: deploy the **Minimalist IP Landing Page** (GitHub Pages) and conduct high-signal outreach (e.g., “Mika” email).                                                    | Apply a **per-diem rate** to all unscheduled inquiries. **Action:** send the “Mika” email and immediately set up the landing page. | **Quarterly:** target one new IP license or major grant proposal submission.                                                       |

## III. Financial & Operational Reality (The Ledger)

### A. Standard Metrics for a Profitable R&D Lab (Enhanced)

| Metric              | Target                                                      | Justification                                                                                                                      |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Annual Revenue**  | \$800,000 to \$1,500,000                                    | This range supports high-level PI draw and ongoing R&D investment driven by IP licensing scarcity.                                 |
| **PI/Founder Draw** | \$150,000 to \$350,000+ USD                                 | Achievable by maintaining a lean WFH structure and keeping overhead below 30% of revenue.                                          |
| **Output Cadence**  | 2–3 white papers plus four major Proof Tags (JSON) per year | This cadence proves technical rigor and supplies the assets needed for contracts and grants.                                       |
| **Core Tooling**    | MythOS Local Foundation and Provenance Ledger               | **Sovereignty:** ensures data integrity, security, and auditable records for clients prioritizing ethical supply chain management. |

### B. The Core IP Manual: Ethical Intelligence Stack (New Insight)

The 1.5 System translates three choreographic disciplines into interdependent technical layers that govern chaos with quantifiable discipline and ethics.

| Layer              | Choreographic Principle             | Technical Function                                                                                                  | Governing Metric                                                                                                                       |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **I. The Rules**   | **Balanchine** (Neoclassicism)      | **Glissé Engine FSM:** defines kinetic grammar and deterministic execution paths, answering “What is the code?”     | **SSI & VZ Score:** measures discipline and execution velocity against a defined pattern.                                              |
| **II. The Urge**   | **Graham** (Contraction/Release)    | **Glitch Engine:** introduces controlled, nondeterministic angular mutation/chaos, answering “How does it invent?”  | **\(\hat{p}\)** (p-value for emergence) and **\(\mathbf{\Gamma}\)** measure the statistical significance of generated innovation.      |
| **III. The Limit** | **Cunningham** (Spatial Discipline) | **Cunningham Mercy Gate:** enforces algorithmic restraint and risk-equity scaling, answering “How does it survive?” | **\(\tau\)-CI (Tau Confidence Interval):** measures structural ambiguity to determine when to pause/hold (Mercy) or execute (Cunning). |

### C. Competing Labs & Strategic Emulation (The Grim Landscape) (Enhanced)

| Entity                   | Primary Product                                  | Strategic Emulation (Your Lesson)                                                                                                                                                        |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wayne McGregor’s CLA** | Acceleration/Novelty (Generative AI)             | **Emulate rigor, not velocity.** Present your constraint (the brakes/Mercy Gate) with the same technical authority that they present their engine (the accelerator).                     |
| **DARPA/NSF Labs**       | Academic Legitimacy/Grants (Provenance)          | **Emulate provenance.** Use the local Provenance Ledger and public DOIs to prove rigor, challenging the institutional model from a secure WFH position.                                  |
| **Project Keystone**     | Cognitive Load Management (Ethical Monetization) | **Emulate boundaries.** Adopt a persona that is discreet, competent, and private. Never appear desperate for a sale—only engage when there is a justified exchange of high-ticket value. |
