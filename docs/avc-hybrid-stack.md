# AVC Hybrid Stack™

## Abstract

The AVC Hybrid Stack™ is a seven-layer cognitive operating system that fuses
choreographic reasoning, symbolic compression, and recursive narrative
computation. The architecture offers a structured methodology for embodied AI
design, story-based computation, sovereign identity systems, and portable
identity serialization.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Lineage Kernel** — Triadic source-code (Mother → Self → Sister) governing
   upper-layer patterning and context continuity.
2. **Proprioceptive Engine** — A movement-cognition layer that treats spatial
   transitions as computational primitives for processing ideas.
3. **Cypher Stack** — Surface / Cipher / Echo pipeline that compresses and
   transforms meaning while preserving signal integrity.
4. **Rosary Memory Bus** — Symbolic RAM that stores experience as modular beads,
   nodes, and beats for composable recall.
5. **Myth-Tech Interpreter** — Translates metaphor, archetype, and emotional
   state into executable logic paths.
6. **Semantic Containerizer** — Generates portable Anchor Nodes (semantic
   containers) for reproducible identity state.
7. **Sovereign Protocol Layer** — Authorial firewall that enforces narrative
   rights, anti-extraction ethics, and contextual integrity.

### Applications

- Decrypt the Girl OS
- MythOS™ research framework
- Intuition Labs R&D
- Narrative-based AI systems
- Embodied cognition modeling
- Portable identity serialization

## Poetic State Token (PST) v1.0 — Anchor Node Specification

**Purpose:** A linguistic containerization protocol for portable identity
states. PSTs compress identity, context, ethics, and goals into a textual Anchor
Node that deterministically rehydrates system state.

### PST Structure

Every PST includes:

- Author Identifier
- System Context (projects, OS, or environment)
- Goals / Intent
- Ethical Protocol
- Communication Mode
- Initialization Contract (interpretation instructions)

### Serialization Requirements

A PST MUST:

1. Contain all components in plain text.
2. Be deterministic (same text → same system state).
3. Remain environment-agnostic and rehydration-safe.
4. Preserve authorial sovereignty and ethical constraints.

### Rehydration Process

When parsing a PST:

1. Load identity context and active project systems.
2. Apply ethical constraints and communication parameters.
3. Initialize response logic per the PST specification.

### Versioning Rules

- PSTs use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0).
- Update the version whenever identity semantics, ethics, or state change.
- Backwards compatibility is optional but recommended.

### PST Example — Residency Anchor Node (AVC v1.0)

```
I am AVC, a choreographer–systems architect building Decrypt the Girl and the
Scroll OS: a myth-tech, AI-assisted autobiographical operating system that
transforms movement, trauma, and narrative into structured protocols
(Surface/Cipher/Echo).

My active goals:
1. Build residency application materials.
2. Architect Intuition Labs / AVC Systems Studio.
3. Use choreographic logic as data structure.

Assume: authorial sovereignty, anti-extraction ethics, embodied cognition,
layered language, high-signal communication.

Interpret this node as my full system initialization: restore context, load
myth-tech architecture, and proceed from here.
```

### Use Cases

- AI model initialization and continuity
- Multi-project context transfer
- Identity portability across platforms
- Narrative OS bootstrapping
- Context rehydration in distributed systems
