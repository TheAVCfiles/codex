# Multi-Dimensional Forensic Dossier (2019–2026)

## Addendum: Evidentiary Expansion + Recovery Pathing

**Purpose.** This addendum operationalizes the dossier into an evidence-first intake and recovery plan that (1) expands the evidentiary index, (2) maps evidence to claims, (3) identifies gaps and fast-paths, and (4) quantifies wage theft/misclassification using documented benchmarks. It is structured for attorney intake, agency filing, and recovery sequencing.

**Compliance note.** No external URLs were fetched and no external systems were accessed while preparing this addendum. Evidence capture steps below are structured for user-side execution.

## 1) Evidence Expansion Matrix (Intake-Ready)

Use this matrix to **add evidence while preserving chain of custody**. For each artifact, capture: (a) source, (b) export method, (c) filename, (d) timestamp, (e) hash, (f) relevance.

**Minimum chain-of-custody package per item**

## 2) Evidence-to-Claim Map (Legal Spine)

**Wage Theft / Misclassification**

- Ledgers + pay logs (EX-LED-DFR), schedules (EX-SCHED-2019_22), rate negotiations (EX-COMM-RATE), 1099s (EX-PAY-1099).
- Demonstrates control + suppressed rates + uncompensated hours.

**IP Conversion / False Origin**

- Original curriculum files (EX-IP-SOVSEQ, EX-IP-PROG), iconography (EX-IP-BFLY).
- Venue programs and credits (EX-VENUE-PROG), performance media (EX-WORK-PERF).
- Demonstrates use of proprietary assets after displacement.

**Economic Abuse / Interference**

- ACP doxxing + mail tampering admissions (EX-DOM-ACP, EX-MAIL-TAMP).
- Service blackouts + storage overflow (EX-DIGI-BLK).
- Financial harm and forced liquidation (EX-BANK-LOSS).

---

## 3) Gaps & Closure Actions

**Critical Gaps**

1. **Hours & duty logs** for 2019–2022 by week and role.
2. **Primary evidence of rates paid** vs market benchmarks.
3. **Direct admission or records** of unauthorized IP use.
4. **Mail tampering proof** tied to specific dates and items.
5. **ACP breach timeline** with cross-verified artifacts.

**Closure Actions**

- Build a **master hours ledger** from calendars + comms + invoices.
- Capture **rate-setting messages** that show control.
- Assemble **before/after IP artifacts** (original file creation timestamps + later public uses).
- Create a **mail-tampering timeline** with envelope scans + admissions.

---

## 4) Wage Theft + Misclassification Quantification Framework

**Data inputs required**

- Number of rehearsal days, show/shoot days, and weeks of work (2019–2022).
- Role mapping per period: Performer, Choreographer, Associate, Producer/Curriculum Architect.

**Benchmarks (per dossier)**

- Performer: $480 per rehearsal day; $985 per show/shoot day.
- Choreographer minimum: 200% of performer rate.
- Associate: 100% of performer rate.
- Touring: $2,810 per week.

**Formula**

- **Base unpaid wages** = Σ((rehearsal days × rate) + (show days × rate) + (weeks × touring rate)) minus amounts paid.
- **CT liquidated damages** = base unpaid wages × 2.
- **CT penalties** = $300 × violations (count by pay period or event).
- **NY WTPA** = up to $5,000 if no pay notice provided.

**Deliverable**

- A year-by-year **Wage Theft Ledger** with totals and statutory multipliers applied.

## 5) Recovery Pathways: Friction Levels + Fast Paths

**Friction Level Key**

- **Low** = agency intake or records demand; low cost; faster response.
- **Medium** = structured negotiation or targeted civil letter; moderate cost/time.
- **High** = litigation or IP damages claims; higher cost/time and complexity.

### Fast Paths (Low to Medium Friction)

1. **CT DOL wage complaint packet**
   - **Friction:** Low
   - **Why fast:** agency intake + clear wage violations.
   - **Dependencies:** hours ledger, pay evidence.
2. **Records demand (10-day clock)**
   - **Friction:** Low–Medium
   - **Why fast:** forces payroll/personnel logs.
   - **Dependencies:** proper service + follow-up.
3. **NY DOL complaint (if nexus)**
   - **Friction:** Low
   - **Why fast:** parallel track with tailored evidence.
   - **Dependencies:** NY nexus proof.

### Mid-Track (Medium Friction)

4. **Retroactive licensing demand for IP**
   - **Friction:** Medium
   - **Why:** can resolve without litigation if exposure is clear.
   - **Dependencies:** strong IP provenance + public use evidence.
5. **Cease & desist + venue notification**
   - **Friction:** Medium
   - **Why:** reputational leverage can drive settlement.
   - **Dependencies:** documented use + credits claims.

### High Friction (Longer Path)

6. **Civil litigation for IP conversion and damages**
   - **Friction:** High
   - **Why:** high burden, complex proof, expensive.
   - **Dependencies:** clear provenance, damages calculation, counsel.

## 6) Timelines, Expectations, and Evidence-Based Probability Drivers

**Timelines (Estimate; verify locally)**

- **Records demand response:** 10–30 days (if compliant).
- **Agency wage complaint intake:** 4–12 weeks for initial response.
- **Pre-suit settlement window:** 30–90 days after formal demand.
- **Litigation timeline:** 12–36 months.

**Primary success drivers**

- Documentary proof of hours/rates and control (stronger = faster outcomes).
- Clear provenance + timestamped IP files.
- Credible, consistent timelines in affidavits.
- Multiple corroborating artifacts (e.g., schedules + comms + pay logs).

**Risk factors**

- Missing hours logs; weak nexus documentation; lack of registration for IP; gaps in chain of custody.

## 7) Economic Stability & Litigation Readiness (Non-Legal Info)

**Immediate stabilization**

- Inventory recurring bills and minimum viable monthly burn.
- Collect all income disruption proof (bank statements, service interruptions).
- Document any housing-related impacts linked to economic abuse.

**Fight-fund readiness**

- Build a simple budget with three tiers: survival, stability, litigation.
- Preserve receipts related to displacement and recovery costs.
- Organize a **single, indexed evidence vault** with hashes and read-only copies.

**Minimum “ready state” checklist**

- Wage ledger complete and cross-validated.
- Evidence index filled for all high-priority items.
- Affidavit draft with timeline.
- Records demand drafted and staged.

## 8) Next-Step Implementation Checklist

1. **Complete the Evidence Expansion Matrix** (Section 1).
2. **Build the hours ledger** from calendars, comms, and invoices.
3. **Generate the wage theft calculation** with statutory multipliers.
4. **Package CT/NY wage packets** (see existing prep kit).
5. **Draft IP licensing demand** with provenance exhibits.
6. **Prepare mail-tampering complaint packet** with timelines and proof.

## 9) Required Artifacts for Dollar-Value Finalization

To finalize exact dollar values for 2019–2022, provide:

- Total rehearsal days, show days, and touring weeks per year.
- Role classification per period.
- Any pay stubs or invoices showing amounts paid.

Once the ledger is complete, the wage theft + misclassification totals can be computed precisely and used in demand letters and agency filings.
