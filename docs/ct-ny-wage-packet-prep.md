# CT/NY Wage Packet Preparation Kit

## Purpose

This document captures a courtroom-ready packet structure for two filing tracks:

1. **CT Department of Labor wage complaint packet** (primary enforcement path).
2. **NY Department of Labor complaint packet** (for documented NY nexus).

The packet design is intentionally neutral, evidence-first, and conservative in monetary estimates.

## Filing strategy notes

1. File CT packet first when CT contacts/worksite/control evidence is strongest.
2. File NY packet when NY nexus evidence is sufficient and document-backed.
3. Reuse shared evidence exhibits but keep each packet tailored to venue standards.
4. Keep language factual and restrained to preserve credibility with agency intake staff.

## Add-on Module: DOL + COVID-period wage theft support

Use this module if the unpaid labor period overlapped with 2020–2022 operations or any period affected by pandemic scheduling disruptions.

### Add these exhibits to both CT and NY packets (when available)

- `11_COVID_SCHEDULING_AND_CONTROL_LOG.pdf`
- `12_PUBLIC_HEALTH_ERA_WORK_CONDITIONS_DECLARATION.pdf`
- `13_REVENUE_CONTINUITY_VS_PAY_GAP_SUMMARY.pdf`

### What to document in the COVID scheduling log

For each event, capture:

- Date and time
- Work request channel (text/email/call)
- Task type (teaching, production, transport, child-facing supervision, digital production)
- Whether task was same-day or emergency
- Whether compensation was offered/paid
- Evidence filename

### Revenue continuity vs pay gap summary

Build a one-page chart that compares:

1. Ongoing operations (classes, showcases, camps, performances, digital products).
2. Worker labor demand (hours, duties, role expansion).
3. Actual wages paid (or lack of pay).

This is useful for agency reviewers because it ties work performed to commercial continuity while showing wage non-payment.

## Add-on Module: DV/coercive-control context for wage enforcement

When coercion or safety threats affected ability to refuse labor, include a **fact-only context addendum** without changing the wage-first focus.

### Optional attachment

- `14_DV_COERCIVE_CONTROL_CONTEXT_ADDENDUM.pdf`

### Include only objective facts

- Dates of threatening or controlling communications.
- How those communications affected work compliance (e.g., inability to refuse shifts/tasks).
- Any documented restrictions on movement, housing, transportation, or communications.
- Link each statement to a message ID, screenshot filename, or third-party record.

### Keep venue-safe framing

- Avoid diagnosis language.
- Avoid speculative motive statements.
- Use: "This context is provided to explain why labor was performed under pressure and without normal negotiation power."

## Rapid assembly checklist (DOL/COVID + DV wage theft)

- [ ] Update `04_HOURS_AND_DUTIES_LEDGER.xlsx` with COVID-era date filters.
- [ ] Add at least 10 timestamped communication exhibits showing task direction/control.
- [ ] Add one summary table linking each duty cluster to uncompensated hours.
- [ ] Add DV/coercive-control context addendum only if documentary support exists.
- [ ] Recalculate conservative damages before filing.
