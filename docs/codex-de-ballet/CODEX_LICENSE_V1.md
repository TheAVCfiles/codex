# Codex License v1.0

**Effective Date:** July 29, 2025  
**Licensor:** Allison Van Cura / Codex de Ballet™

This hybrid license governs the use of the PyRouette™ choreographic system, all associated `.rouette` source files, generated glyphs, textual folios, and derivative renderings (collectively, the **Codex Works**). It blends software licensing standards with choreographic moral rights to preserve authorship, enforce attribution, and control commercial use.

---

## 1. Definitions

- **PyRouette™ System** – The runtime, interpreters, DSL syntax (Cipherette), renderer modules (Glisscode, EnCroix), and any related tooling required to execute `.rouette` choreography files.
- **Codex Work** – Any choreography encoded in `.rouette`, its compiled folio, generated glyphs, associated metadata, and export files rendered through PyRouette™.
- **Authorized User** – A person or institution that has received explicit permission from the Licensor to access, study, or stage Codex Works.
- **Executable Platform** – Any software, service, or hardware capable of parsing, interpreting, or rendering `.rouette` files.
- **Glitch Trace** – A creative variation, emergent behavior, or algorithmic surprise produced by the PyRouette™ system’s generative features.

---

## 2. Grant of Rights

1. **Personal & Educational Use.** Authorized Users may study, rehearse, and privately perform Codex Works for non-commercial purposes, provided all attribution requirements are followed.
2. **Non-Commercial Distribution.** You may share unmodified Codex Works for archival or educational purposes so long as this license is included in full and no fees are charged.
3. **No Implied Transfer.** Ownership of the underlying choreography, glyph design, and PyRouette™ tooling remains exclusively with the Licensor. This license does **not** transfer copyright.

---

## 3. Executable Protection

1. You may not deploy, integrate, or host `.rouette` files on any Executable Platform without a written platform agreement from the Licensor.
2. Automated playback, visualization, or AI-training pipelines must register the Codex Work’s unique hash with the Licensor prior to use.
3. License notices embedded in `.rouette` headers may not be removed, obfuscated, or altered.

---

## 4. Artistic Derivative Clause

1. You may not publish, sell, license, or stage derivative choreographies that substantially rely on a Codex Work without the Licensor’s written approval.
2. Approved derivatives must:
   - Identify the original Codex Work and author.
   - Provide a changelog summarizing new material vs. inherited phrases.
   - Retain the original glitch cues, or document where they were intentionally removed.

---

## 5. Marketplace Terms

1. Codex Works and any derivative `.rouette` files may only be sold, licensed, or commercially distributed through an official Codex de Ballet™ marketplace or a partner authorized in writing.
2. Royalties, commissions, and reporting terms will be governed by the applicable marketplace agreement. Unauthorized sales or licensing are grounds for immediate termination.

---

## 6. Moral Rights Assertion

1. The Licensor retains the right to be credited as the creator and interpreter of every Codex Work.
2. No staging, recording, or adaptation may distort the intent, dedication, or cultural context of the original choreography.
3. Upon request, the Licensor may designate a repetiteur or representative to oversee rehearsals or archival staging to ensure fidelity.

---

## 7. Glitch Attribution Clause

1. Any Glitch Trace or emergent movement discovered while executing a Codex Work is still subject to this license.
2. Publications, restagings, or derivative choreographies must cite the PyRouette™ system as the generative source of the Glitch Trace.
3. Failing to attribute a Glitch Trace constitutes misrepresentation and voids this license.

---

## 8. Termination

1. Any violation of Sections 3–7 immediately revokes all rights granted under this license.
2. Upon termination, you must cease all performances, destroy unapproved copies, and notify collaborators of the revoked status.
3. Reinstatement requires written consent from the Licensor and may involve additional fees or reparative acknowledgments.

---

## 9. Updates & Versioning

1. Future revisions of this license will be published via official Codex de Ballet™ channels and Git repositories.
2. Continued use of Codex Works after a license update implies acceptance of the new version unless you provide written objection within 30 days.
