# Codex de Ballet™ Delivery Stack

Codex de Ballet™ is a choreographic sovereignty kit built on the PyRouette™ runtime. This directory documents the client-facing deliverables, submission pipeline, and licensing artifacts that emerged from the Lilith Loop in 6/8 product scoping sessions.

## Product Pillars

- **PyRouette™ Runtime** – The executable core that interprets `.rouette` DSL scores.
- **Cipherette DSL** – A domain-specific language for choreographic scripting.
- **Glisscode Renderer** – Visualizes `.rouette` movement data.
- **EnCroix Formatter** – Produces printable folios and archival scores.
- **Codex de Ballet™ Folios** – Timestamped, licensed publications that combine glyphs, metadata, and choreography.
- **MYTHEMATICS™** – Poetic logic engine guiding stylistic rules and glitch ethics.

## Client Submission Requirements

To translate repertory into Codex folios, the studio requests:

1. **Reference Video** – MP4 link or upload of the choreography.
2. **Choreographic Notes** – Intent statements, section breakdowns, and tempo markers.
3. **Music or BPM** – Helps align `.rouette` counts with the score.
4. **Performer Roles** – Names or archetypes for dancer class instantiation.
5. **Permissions** – Confirmation that the submitting party controls the repertoire.

Optional enhancements include lineage notes, symbolic motifs, or desired glitch parameters.

## Deliverable Bundle Overview

A typical Codex delivery contains:

- `Folio_001_LilithLoop.rouette` – Executable choreography with embedded license header.
- `Folio_001_LilithLoop.md` – Mobile-friendly folio with glyph descriptions, metadata, and dedication.
- `Folio_001_metadata.json` – Structured data for registries and renderers.
- `receipt_of_authorship.md` – Timestamped proof-of-origin slip.
- `CODEX_LICENSE_V1.md` – Hybrid license controlling execution, derivatives, and glitch attribution.
- `SUBMISSION_INTAKE_FORM.md` – Intake questionnaire for future collaborators.

## Workflow Summary

1. **Ingest** submission materials and confirm rights.
2. **Transcode** key phrases into `.rouette` syntax using Cipherette style guides.
3. **Render** proof outputs via Glisscode and EnCroix.
4. **Annotate** folio with metadata, dedication, and glitch notes.
5. **Seal** with Codex License and authorship receipt.
6. **Deliver** as a zipped archive or GitHub release under @TheAVCfiles.

## Versioning & Future Work

- Codex Folio #001 anchors Aurora’s lineage with a “this one’s for you” dedication.
- Future folios will extend the archive with Repetoile adaptations and newly commissioned works.
- Upcoming engineering tasks: tempo quantization, auto-glyph rendering, QR-based verification, and license-aware runtime guards.
