# Record-Restoration Packet (2019–2021)

## 1) Authorship and Institutional Scope Map

### Your side (authorship + labor you control)

These are your claim lanes because they’re creative authorship + professional work performed by you:

- Choreography design + production concepts
- Program architecture + written materials
- Operational coordination + unpaid/uncompensated labor
- Reservation of rights (no waiver) — ensures you’re not conceding IP just because you participated

**Time box / scope:** Act 1 is explicitly framed as 2019–2021 labor, compensation, and IP exposure.

### Institutional side (their containers)

These are typically the organization’s assets, not authorship:

- Venue/platform, enrollment lists, branding/marketing channels, scheduling systems.
- “Operational control” mechanisms (how the work was directed/managed).

**What matters:** your record says the pattern indicates ongoing labor under operational control, which is the factual backbone you preserve without turning it into a dramatic narrative.

### The overlap zone (where disputes usually happen)

This is where institutions quietly “keep the machine running”:

- Anything you authored that got embedded into their ongoing offerings (curriculum structure, class formats, rehearsal flow, program notes, production systems). Your record explicitly anticipates IP exposure as part of Act 1.
- Anything distributed/performed/published without clear credit: you state works authored/co-authored were published or performed without proper credit/compensation.

### Your evidence spine (keep it boring and lethal)

You already have a clean index pattern:

- Program artifact (Flipsnack program dated May 8, 2021)
- Email correspondence transmitting program links
- Payment records (Zelle / PayPal 2020–2021)
- Timeline anchors: Sept 2019 expansion, 2020 1099-NEC $17,021, 2021 Zelle tied to enrollments

## 2) Neutral Record-Restoration Statement (paste-ready)

**Subject:** Record correction + preservation of authorship (2019–2021)

I am writing to formally preserve and correct the factual record regarding my professional work performed during 2019–2021, including labor, compensation, and intellectual-property exposure.

**Scope:**
This notice concerns my tangible labor and authored contributions, including choreography design, production concepts, program architecture, written materials, operational coordination, and uncompensated professional work performed during the period August 2020 – May 2021 (and related continuity within 2019–2021).

**Timeline anchors (for alignment):**

- Sept 2019: Afterschool expansion; instructional reliance begins.
- 2020: Continuous instruction; a 1099-NEC was issued in the amount of $17,021.
- 2021: Recurrent Zelle payments tied to class enrollments.

**Authorship + attribution:**
Certain works I authored or co-authored were published or performed without proper author credit or compensation.

**Reservation of rights:**
This communication is not a waiver. No intellectual property rights or authorship claims were waived. All rights remain reserved.

**Request (record restoration):**

1. Please confirm in writing that your records reflect my role as an author/contributor for the relevant materials and programs within the stated period.
2. Please provide (or preserve) copies of any materials that contain my authored work, including program documents, distribution links, and internal references to curriculum/choreography/program architecture.

**Attached/available exhibits (representative):**

- Program artifact dated May 8, 2021 (Flipsnack)
- Email correspondence transmitting program links
- Payment records (Zelle / PayPal 2020–2021)

I affirm that the above is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

Sincerely,
Allison Van Cura
