# Decrypt The Girl — 28-Day Mutation Cycle (Advocacy Scale)

**Purpose**
A protective, repeatable 28-day cadence that moves Decrypt The Girl from signal capture to advocacy-ready outputs without exposure to accusation or narrative drift. This cycle is designed to run as autonomously as possible while maintaining strict documentation ethics.

**Scope**

- Systems + signals only.
- No naming of individuals.
- No accusations.
- Only verifiable, time-stamped documentation.

---

## Core Laws (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Systems over stories.**
2. **Evidence before interpretation.**
3. **No public claims about individuals.**
4. **Every artifact is audit-ready.**
5. **If it cannot be cited, it does not ship.**

---

## Mutation Cycle Overview

The 28-day cycle is four movements of 7 days each:

1. **Ignition (Days 1–7)** — capture, stabilize, and index signals.
2. **Distillation (Days 8–14)** — compress signals into neutral summaries.
3. **Advocacy (Days 15–21)** — convert summaries into regulator-ready packets.
4. **Shielding (Days 22–28)** — lock, archive, and reset exposure surfaces.

Each movement produces specific outputs with pre-defined formats.

---

## Movement 1 — Ignition (Days 1–7)

**Goal:** Capture raw signals and lock them into a neutral ledger.

**Inputs**

- Search results (name variants, industries, geography)
- Archive captures (Wayback / cached)
- Image reverse-search results
- PDFs and public listings

**Actions (Daily)**

- Log new signals into the ledger (facts only).
- Save screenshots with timestamps.
- Update the evidence index.

**Outputs**

- **Ledger updates** (CSV)
- **Evidence bundle** (date-stamped)

**Ship Rule**

- If a source is not public or not verifiable, it does not enter the ledger.

---

## Movement 2 — Distillation (Days 8–14)

**Goal:** Convert raw signals into neutral summaries.

**Actions**

- Create a **Perception Report Draft** (template-based).
- Build a **Context Alignment Table** (factual alignment only).
- Separate “legacy content” vs. “current content.”

**Outputs**

- **Draft Perception Report**
- **Context Alignment Table**
- **Legacy Index Table**

**Ship Rule**

- No interpretation. Only visible alignment/misalignment.

---

## Movement 3 — Advocacy (Days 15–21)

**Goal:** Transform neutral summaries into advocacy-grade deliverables.

**Actions**

- Generate a **Regulator-Safe Intake Packet** (facts only).
- Produce a **Press-Ready Fact Pack** (one page, neutral).
- Prepare a **Safety Literacy Guide** (parent/student facing).

**Outputs**

- **Intake Packet** (private)
- **Press Fact Pack** (public-safe)
- **Safety Literacy Guide** (public-safe)

**Ship Rule**

- Any document that implies intent is rejected and rewritten.

---

## Movement 4 — Shielding (Days 22–28)

**Goal:** Lock the archive, reduce exposure, and reset for the next cycle.

**Actions**

- Archive the ledger and evidence bundle.
- Update canonical profile materials (if needed).
- Run a clean-room verification of the report outputs.
- Snapshot new changes in exposure surfaces.

**Outputs**

- **Final Perception Report** (PDF)
- **Archive snapshot** (date-stamped)
- **Reset checklist** (for next cycle)

**Ship Rule**

- If documentation cannot be re-verified, it is downgraded to “unconfirmed” and excluded.

---

## Autonomy & Tooling (No-Code, Low-Friction)

**Daily Automation**

- Drop artifacts into a single **INBOX** folder.
- Trigger ledger entry via shortcut or repeatable form.
- Auto-build a daily “runtime packet” (ZIP).

**Weekly Automation**

- Generate a weekly digest summary (neutral bullets).
- Export new items for append-only archive.

**Monthly Automation**

- Finalize the perception report.
- Rebuild safety literacy outputs.
- Reset cycle timer.

---

## Advocacy Scale Protocols

**Audience Modes**

- **Counsel / Regulator:** Intake Packet (private, factual).
- **Press:** Fact Pack (neutral, 1–2 pages).
- **Public / Parents:** Safety Literacy Guide (rule-based, no names).

**Neutral Language Gate**
Every output must pass this test:

- “Could a regulator audit this without requiring belief?”
- If no, rewrite.

---

## Evidence Hygiene

**Required Fields for Every Entry**

- Date collected
- Source type (search / archive / PDF / image)
- Source URL
- Local filename
- One-sentence neutral note

**Disallowed Content**

- Speculation about motive
- Allegations about individuals
- “This proves…” language

---

## Cycle Metrics (Track Without Story)

- **Count of new public signals**
- **Count of archived captures**
- **Count of alignment/misalignment entries**
- **Number of legacy items removed or de-indexed**
- **Number of outputs shipped (reports/packets/guides)**

These metrics measure _movement_, not conflict.

## Canon Sentence (Use Everywhere)

> “I document systems and observable signals. I don’t make claims about individuals.”

## Appendix B — Placeholder Cipher Anchors

When Decrypt corpus excerpts are available, anchor each movement with poem codes (e.g., A1, B5b, C3) to reinforce the narrative spine without adding interpretation.
