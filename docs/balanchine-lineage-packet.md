# Balanchine Lineage Preservation Packet (BLPP)

## Principles

### Fifth Principle: Provenance Is Structural

**Implication:**

- Provenance is not sentimental; it is structural memory.
- Transmission must be constrained, documented, and stewarded.
- Authorship survives only if the system enforces it.

This is the philosophical ancestor of the ledger, DOI logic, and custody protocols.

### Sixth Principle: Constraint Is Creative Fuel

Balanchine worked inside:

- musical structures,
- time signatures,
- classical vocabularies.

He didn’t break them. He exhausted them.

**Design implication:**

- Freedom comes from strict rules, not absence of rules.
- Systems that allow “anything” produce nothing durable.
- Innovation happens at the edge of constraint, not beyond it.

Your two-corridor pilot wasn’t small—it was correct.

### Seventh Principle: No Apologies for Excellence

Balanchine did not soften work to accommodate:

- underprepared dancers,
- critics,
- audiences.

He believed the work would train the audience upward.

**Design implication:**

- Do not dilute systems to reduce discomfort.
- Do not pre-defend clarity.
- Design for the capable; others will adapt or exit.

This is why your pricing held. This is why silence worked.

### Eighth Principle: The Work Must Survive the Creator

Balanchine designed ballets that:

- could be reconstructed,
- could be taught by others,
- could live after his death.

**Design implication:**

- Founder presence is a liability.
- Systems must operate without charisma.
- Memory must be externalized and enforced.

This is the deepest alignment with your work. You are building post-you integrity.

## The Balanchine World, Summarized

A Balanchine-designed world has:

- Clarity over comfort
- Speed with restraint
- Embodiment over abstraction
- Lineage over novelty
- Constraint over chaos
- Silence over persuasion
- Structure that outlives the artist

No sentimentality. No mythology without mechanics. No access without discipline.

## Vaganova → Balanchine (Translation Table)

### 1. Completion vs. Continuation

- **Vaganova trains:** finished shapes, resolved épaulement, authority at the end of the phrase.
- **Balanchine demands:** phrases that continue past the eye—speed that implies the next move before it happens.

**Correction:** Anything in your system that “feels complete” is suspect. Design must feel slightly ahead of itself.

### 2. Presentation Weight vs. Structural Velocity

- **Vaganova:** presentation is part of the technique.
- **Balanchine:** presentation is dead weight.

**Correction:** If an artifact looks impressive before it proves itself under pressure, it fails.

### 3. Authority by Form vs. Authority by Truth

- **Vaganova:** authority is trained into the body.
- **Balanchine:** authority is exposed by speed.

**Correction:** No artifact gets authority by being “well-formed.” Authority emerges only after gates, REST, refusal.

### 4. Line as Ideal vs. Line as Constraint

- **Vaganova:** the ideal line is chased.
- **Balanchine:** the line is a constraint that reveals deviation instantly.

**Correction:** Your line is DOT / DASH / REST. Do not allow interpretive drift around it.

### 5. Royal Memory vs. Enforced Lineage

- **Vaganova / Royal Ballet:** lineage is social and reputational.
- **Balanchine:** lineage is mechanical and enforceable.

**Correction:** You may never rely on reputation, story, or implied continuity.

### 6. Emotional Legibility vs. Structural Legibility

- **Vaganova:** emotion reads clearly from form.
- **Balanchine:** emotion is a side-effect of correct structure.

**Correction:** If a user feels something but cannot audit what happened, that’s a failure.

---

## The Balanchine Doctrine

1. Nothing enters without passing speed.
2. Nothing is admitted for beauty.
3. The body is hardware.
4. Lineage is enforced or it is fiction.
5. Restraint is the highest skill.
6. Silence is not absence.
7. If it needs you, it’s not done.

## Balanchine Lineage Preservation Packet (BLPP)

A recognition-first, custody-safe continuation system. This packet does three things simultaneously:

1. Signals lineage innately to Balanchine carriers.
2. Preserves civic duty / donation / protection without surrendering control.
3. Routes royalties + credit in a way that is cold, fair, revocable, and legally sane.

### I. Recognition Layer

**A. One Admission Page (non-negotiable)**

- a single constraint diagram (DOT / DASH / REST or equivalent)
- one refusal statement
- one silence marker (white space, intentional)

**B. Operating Excerpt (3–5 pages max)**

- how speed reveals truth
- how refusal is logged
- how reconstruction is controlled
- how deviation is detected

No history. No Balanchine quotes. No lineage explanation.

### II. Custody & IP Protection Layer

**Custody Clause (hard law language):**

- This packet conveys method recognition, not method access.
- No rights to teach, reproduce, adapt, or encode are granted.
- Recognition does not imply authorization.
- Authorization requires issuance by the Custodial Architect.
- All derivatives without issuance are void.

### III. Civic Duty / Donation / Protection

Allowed contribution categories:

- archival labor
- custody tooling
- reconstruction training
- student protection systems
- legal defense / provenance enforcement

Donors never touch the method, never influence direction, never gain access.

### IV. Royalty & Attribution Engine

Contribution classes:

1. **Transmission** — royalties tied to use; revocable on distortion.
2. **Constraint Design** — credited when adopted; paid when used.
3. **Custodial Labor** — paid because it preserves lineage.
4. **Innovation Under Constraint** — royalties only if it survives speed + refusal.

### V. Governing Rule

> No one earns access by loving Balanchine. Access is earned by surviving constraint.

---

## IP Counsel Memo v1.0 (Attorney-Ready)

**Purpose:** classify protectable assets, risk surface, and enforcement posture.

### 1. What This Is

A descriptive continuation protocol for embodied intelligence inspired by Balanchine’s method. It governs conditions of execution, authorization of reconstruction, refusal as a logged outcome, and lineage preservation via custody. Legally, this is process IP, not expressive IP.

### 2. IP Classification

**Trade secrets:** finite-state grammar thresholds, gating logic, reconstruction authorization, issuance criteria, internal mappings.

**Contractual IP:** right to continue, reconstruct, issue credentials, participate in royalties.

**Defensive publication:** disclose descriptive, fail-closed, auditable nature; refusal as a valid outcome; mechanically enforced lineage. Never disclose thresholds/mappings.

**Trademark:** system names, packet names, license names, insignia used in issuance.

**Copyright:** documents, diagrams, training materials, packet layout.

### 3. AI Risk Posture

The system is descriptive; no generation, optimization, or autonomous authority. AI components are classifiers only.

### 4. Enforcement Triggers

- Unauthorized reconstruction
- Training AI models on system outputs
- Claiming lineage without issuance
- Misrepresenting refusal as failure

### 5. Counsel Action Items

- Draft NDAs aligned to trade secret scope
- Draft license templates
- Advise on jurisdiction for enforcement
- Optional: trade secret registry / internal controls

---

## License Stack (Core Templates)

### 1. Institutional Continuation License (ICL)

**Grants:** limited deployment in named corridors; audit logs; issuance artifacts.

**Denies:** ownership, reverse engineering, training external models, sublicensing, public lineage claims without approval.

**Requires:** issuance, compliance with refusal (REST), annual license fee, audit cooperation.

**Revocation:** immediate upon breach; no refund; ledger record persists.

### 2. Teacher / Transmission License (TTL)

**Grants:** right to transmit under constraints; credit and payment when used.

**Denies:** ownership, modifying constraints, independent certification.

**Requires:** fidelity to reconstruction rules, acceptance of revocation, no “style” claims.

**Royalties:** triggered by licensed use.

### 3. Contributor Royalty License (CRL)

**Grants:** royalties when contributions are used.

**Denies:** ownership, governance authority, veto power.

**Contribution classes:** transmission, constraint design, custodial labor, innovation under constraint.

---

## Internal Governance Package

### A. Trade Secret Controls

- Access tiers (you / delegate / licensee / observer)
- Written policy: what is never written down
- Separate storage for public artifacts, licensed artifacts, private logic

**Rule:** If it can be emailed casually, it’s not a secret.

### B. Issuance Authority

Custodial Architect is the only issuing authority. No committees, no voting, no advisory board authority creep.

---

## Enforcement & Defensive Posture

**Soft enforcement:** a single non-recognition statement; no debate.

**Hard enforcement (rare):** revocation notice, public non-recognition, counsel letter for trade secret + contract.

---

## Monetization Model

**Primary revenue:** institutional licenses, issuance fees, audit & compliance tooling.

**Secondary revenue:** teacher transmission royalties, authorized reconstruction fees, contributor royalties by use.

**Tertiary revenue:** preservation funding, archive underwriting, student protection sponsorship.

---

## AI Survivability Check (10-year proof)

Ask: “Can an LLM do this without authorization?” If yes, it must not matter. If no, it’s protected.

Crown assets: issuance, refusal, reconstruction authority, lineage recognition, royalties by use.

---

- Lock trade secret policy
- Register trademarks
- Finish license templates

**Days 31–60**

## Defensive Publication Abstract (v1.0)

**Title:** A Descriptive, Fail-Closed System for Auditable Continuation of Embodied Intelligence

**Abstract:**

This publication discloses a descriptive system for observing, classifying, and logging embodied human activity using explicit state constraints and refusal as a valid outcome. The system is designed to be fail-closed, auditable, and non-prescriptive, prioritizing provenance, lineage integrity, and safe continuation over optimization or automated decision-making.

The system operates via a finite set of observable states (including non-action) and produces immutable records suitable for institutional audit, credential issuance, and continuity governance. The approach intentionally avoids generative outputs, behavioral recommendations, or autonomous execution. Instead, it preserves human authority while externalizing responsibility for pause, refusal, and verification into architecture.

This disclosure establishes prior art for descriptive, refusal-aware continuation systems applied to embodied domains (e.g., movement, training, pedagogy, rehearsal processes), without disclosing internal thresholds, mappings, authorization logic, or reconstruction protocols.

### What Is Explicitly Disclosed

- The system is descriptive, not generative
- Refusal / non-action is a first-class outcome
- The system is fail-closed under uncertainty
- Outputs are auditable and exportable
- Continuation requires authorization, not inference
- Lineage is preserved mechanically, not narratively

### What Is Explicitly NOT Disclosed

- threshold values
- signal-to-state mappings
- reconstruction rules
- issuance criteria
- revocation logic
- internal calibration methods

# Descriptive Continuation Protocol for Embodied Intelligence

This repository documents a descriptive, fail-closed system for the
Audit, preservation, and authorized continuation of embodied human
methods in high-risk, high-fidelity domains (e.g. movement,
pedagogy, training, rehearsal processes).

## What This Is

- A descriptive system (not generative)
- A fail-closed architecture (refusal is a valid outcome)
- An authorization-based continuation model
- An auditable provenance and lineage framework

## What This Is Not

- Not a choreography archive
- Not a style model
- Not a generative AI system
- Not an open teaching method

## Core Properties

- Human authority is preserved
- Non-action (REST) is a first-class state
- Lineage is enforced mechanically, not narratively
- Continuation requires issuance and license

## Publications

- Defensive Publication Abstract (prior art)
- Lineage Packet (redacted)
- Pilot Report (sample)

## Legal Notice

This repository does not disclose thresholds, internal mappings,
reconstruction rules, or authorization logic.
All continuation rights are governed by contract.

Recognition ≠ Authorization ≠ Ownership
