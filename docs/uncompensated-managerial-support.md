## Factual Context (Mother as De Facto Manager)

During the periods covered by this archive, Allison Van Cura’s mother functioned as a de facto creative and administrative manager without compensation.

**Responsibilities included:** scheduling coordination, logistical management, documentation assistance, continuity of communication, and operational support necessary for the generation and preservation of professional creative work.

These functions align with standard managerial services in the performing arts and creative industries, which are customarily compensated as a percentage of generated or recovered proceeds.

This acknowledgment is included to accurately reflect labor contributions and does not assert a union designation or licensing status.

## 1) Reimbursement & Cost‑Shifting Ledger (Fact Tool)

**Purpose:** Document out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred to fulfill contracted or requested work, where reimbursement did not occur.

This is not an accusation. It is an accounting record.

### 📄 Reimbursement & Cost‑Shifting Ledger (Private / Draft / Factual)

**Name:** Allison Van Cura

**Notes (neutral):**
These expenses were incurred to meet requested deliverables during a 1099 engagement. Payments were made directly by the contractor and were not reimbursed.

**Why this ledger matters**

- Establishes cost‑shifting
- Separates labor vs. materials
- Documents that Jill was paid by Allison (not the institution)
- Avoids minor‑employment misclassification (where not applicable)

**Do not total this yet.** Totals come later with counsel.

## 3) Attorney‑Ready Questions (Anti‑Oversharing Tool)

**Purpose:** Prevent over‑sharing while still moving forward. Bring only these questions to any consultation.

### 📄 Attorney Consultation Questions (Prep)

**Classification & Reimbursement**

1. As a 1099 contractor, how are unreimbursed expenses typically handled?
2. Does paying additional labor out‑of‑pocket strengthen a reimbursement or unjust‑enrichment claim?

**Attribution & Asset Use** 3. How is continued use of creative assets evaluated when compensation ends? 4. How much weight do prior credits and acknowledgments carry?

**Family & Minor Context** 5. How should paid assistance by a family member be documented? 6. When does minor involvement require special handling — and when does it not? 7. What should not be alleged until discovery?

**Strategy** 8. What documentation should remain private? 9. What actions could weaken future claims if done prematurely? 10. What is the safest next step if no immediate litigation is pursued?

**Rule for consultations**

- Bring documents, not stories
- Answer questions only as asked
- Do not speculate on intent
- Do not label conduct as “theft” or “exploitation” unless advised

## 4) Protected Unpaid Debts & Commissions (Framework)

This section outlines a **priority‑payment structure** that recognizes unpaid family labor as protected obligations, aligned with common industry commission norms and restitution frameworks.

### Mother as Long‑Term Unpaid Manager (“Momager”) — 10% Commission

**Classification:** Allison’s mother has functioned as a de facto personal manager and administrator for many years without formal pay. In entertainment management, a 10% commission on gross revenue is a widely used baseline for personal managers.

**Entitlement (summary):** Allocate **10% of gross proceeds** from Allison’s creative work, recovery, or related income as a manager commission. Treat this as a **priority debt** that is paid off the top before other distributions.

#### Template Clause — Manager’s 10% Commission (Mother)

> **Manager Commission (Mother).** In consideration of [Mother’s Name]’s long‑term management and administrative services provided without compensation, [Allison] (the “Artist”) agrees to allocate to [Mother’s Name] a sum equal to ten percent (10%) of any and all Gross Proceeds (as defined herein) derived from the Artist’s creative works or related income. This 10% Manager Commission shall be calculated on the gross amount of any income, recovery, or funding received by or on behalf of the Artist, and shall be disbursed to [Mother’s Name] prior to any other distributions or payments. The Manager Commission is intended as compensation for past and ongoing managerial contributions, mirroring standard industry commission rates. The obligation to pay this 10% commission is a priority debt of the Artist and shall be treated as a protected expense, not subject to discretionary reduction or delay.

### Sister as Contributor & Unpaid Labor — 20% Restitution Share

**Classification:** Jill Van Cura contributed professional‑quality labor (choreography, staging, performance, video assistance) without formal pay, including in youth/early‑adult periods. This includes work that supported the creation of derivative outputs (curricula, digital assets, staging systems).

**Entitlement (summary):** Allocate **20% of gross proceeds** from projects to which Jill’s labor or creative input directly or indirectly contributed. Treat this as a **priority restitution allocation** for unpaid labor and delayed compensation.

#### Template Clause — Contributor’s 20% Restitution (Sister)

> **Contributor Restitution (Sister).** In recognition of the substantial professional services and intellectual contributions provided by [Sister’s Name] (the “Contributor”) from childhood through young adulthood — often under unpaid or underage conditions — [Allison] hereby allocates to [Sister’s Name] a twenty percent (20%) share of any and all Gross Proceeds (as defined herein) derived from the Artist’s works, projects, or enterprises to which the Contributor’s labor, performance, or creative input directly or indirectly contributed. This 20% Contributor Restitution is intended as both compensation for the fair value of past work and as restitution for the lack of prior payment. Accordingly, the Contributor’s 20% share shall be distributed immediately upon receipt of any Gross Proceeds, before any other costs, debts, or distributions are paid, and shall not be reduced by any other obligation. The allocation covers, without limitation, proceeds arising from: (i) the Nutcracker production identified as JILL–2019–001 and any revivals or derivatives thereof; (ii) digital or choreographic works developed at Dance Factory Ridgefield (DFR) or other studios with the Contributor’s involvement; (iii) any curricula, programs, or frameworks co‑developed by the Contributor that are exploited commercially by the Artist or her affiliates; and (iv) any settlements, awards, or grants obtained in connection with claims of misappropriation or unpaid labor relating to the Contributor’s work. This obligation to the Contributor is acknowledged as a protected debt and shall be enforceable against the Artist or any successor or assign receiving such Gross Proceeds.

### Priority Payment Structure (Summary)

- **Gross Proceeds** should be defined broadly (performances, licensing, teaching/consulting fees, grants, settlements, awards).
- **Priority and precedence:** 10% to mother, 20% to sister, paid immediately on receipt of funds.
- **Protected debt characterization:** treat as operational debts, not discretionary profit share.
- **Survivability:** obligations should persist through entity changes, licensing, or settlements.

#### Template Clause — Allocation of Gross Proceeds (Priority Payment)

> **Allocation of Gross Proceeds.** For purposes of this Agreement, Gross Proceeds shall mean any and all amounts of money or value received by [Allison] (the “Artist”) or any entity affiliated with her, directly or indirectly, as a result of (or in connection with) the Artist’s creative works, performances, intellectual property, services, or any claims relating thereto. Gross Proceeds include, without limitation: revenue from live performances or productions; royalties, licensing fees, or sales of creative content or curriculum; consulting or teaching fees; grants or sponsorships awarded for the Artist’s projects; and any legal recovery, settlement, or award obtained by or on behalf of the Artist relating to her creative endeavors.
>
> From each instance of Gross Proceeds received, the following priority disbursements shall be made immediately and before any other use of funds: (a) 10% of the Gross Proceeds to [Mother’s Name], as a commission for long‑term management and administrative support provided to the Artist (“Manager Commission”); and (b) 20% of the Gross Proceeds to [Sister’s Name], as restitution for past contributions and unpaid labor provided to the Artist’s projects (“Contributor Restitution”). The parties expressly agree that these allocations are operational debts and fiduciary obligations of the Artist, taking precedence over any other distributions, expenses, or debt payments out of the Gross Proceeds.
>
> The Manager Commission and Contributor Restitution shall be calculated on a gross (first‑dollar) basis — no further deductions or offsets shall reduce the amount due to [Mother’s Name] and [Sister’s Name] under this clause. These payments shall be made or remitted to them (or their designated trust/accounts) as soon as the Gross Proceeds are received, and in any event no later than ten (10) business days thereafter. The Artist shall, if necessary, hold the above‑percentage amounts in trust for the benefit of [Mother’s Name] and [Sister’s Name] until paid. The intent of the parties is that [Mother’s Name] and [Sister’s Name] receive their respective shares prior to any distribution of net income to the Artist or payment to any third‑party (excepting normal tax withholdings or transaction fees, if applicable). The Artist further agrees that these obligations are binding and irrevocable; she waives any right to re‑characterize these payments as voluntary gifts or discretionary bonuses. In any accounting of project finances, the Manager Commission and Contributor Restitution shall be listed as due payables, not as profit shares.
