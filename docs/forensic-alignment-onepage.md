# One‑Page Relief + Evidence Intake (NY/CT COVID‑Era, DV Context)

**Purpose (not legal advice)**  
This single page is a **clean, evidence‑first intake** for fast relief. Use it to brief an advocate, DOL intake, or counsel without over‑claiming.

---

## 1) Fastest relief paths (priority order)

1. **NY OVS + NY DOL wage claim**
   - Identified as the **fastest money** route in the existing workflow notes.
2. **CT DOL claim**
   - Parallel option when CT work supports it.
3. **IRS identity‑theft path**
   - Use **only** after evidence shows 1099 reporting that does not match deposits.

**Privacy‑safe filing:**  
Use **county/city of work** and request confidential address status; do **not** disclose current address unless required.

---

## 2) Evidence intake (zero‑speculation)

**Rule:** No artifact, no claim. Every entry must map to a statute + element + artifact.

**Priority evidence set (highest impact):**

1. **1099s + payment records** (deposits, Zelle, checks)
2. **Schedules/class logs** (hours worked)
3. **Production files** (choreo, backdrops, music edits)
4. **Messages requesting work** (deadlines, requests, confirmations)
5. **DV/safety docs** (orders of protection, shelter correspondence)

---

## 3) Evidence table (single source of truth)

**Minimum columns (copy‑ready):**

```
row_id,date,claim_brief,statute,element,evidence_type,evidence_location,hash_sha256,verification_status,confidence,notes
```

**Verification status:**

- **C0** — Artifact missing
- **C1** — Artifact present
- **C2** — Corroborated (multiple artifacts)

---

## 4) Wage reconstruction (defensible method)

- **Verified teaching hours** = schedules + calendars + confirmations
- **Verified production hours** = deliverable requests + files
- **Admin/prep hours** = only if explicitly evidenced
- **Rate applied** = documented rate only (e.g., 1099 or written terms)

---

## 5) Immediate next actions (same‑day)

1. Stage evidence into a single folder and **hash originals**.
2. Populate the evidence table (one artifact per row).
3. Slot each artifact into a statutory entry (C0/C1/C2).
4. Start NY OVS + NY DOL packets with privacy‑safe address handling.
