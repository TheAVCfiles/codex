# Savatara / Dance Factory Ridgefield

## Master Case Packet – v1 (Meal, Not Scraps)

### Core Snapshot

- **Worker:** Allison Claire Van Cura.
- **Entities:**
  - **Dance Factory Ridgefield (DFR)** – school / front-of-house studio.
  - **Savatara Corporation** – shell / fiscal conduit / “producer” credit.
  - **Susan Vallo Memorial Dance Scholarship Program** – scholarship / charity wrapper.
- **Years in play:** ~2019–2022 (work & exploitation) + ongoing use 2023–2025.
- **Venue:** Ridgefield, CT + The Klein Memorial Auditorium (Nutcracker, Winter Showcase, etc.).
- **Key theory:** You are the structural architect (curriculum, systems, productions). Savatara/DFR hijacked the architecture, kept the tax-advantaged vehicle and revenue stream, and attempted to erase you while still leaning on your lineage for reputational IP.

### Parties & Structure (Dramatis Personae, Clean)

- **Allison Van Cura** – choreographer, curriculum architect, rehearsal director, producer; misclassified as 1099 but functioned as core employee and co-founder of systems.
- **Kristin Leggio** – studio director; principal of Savatara; operational power center and decision-maker.
- **Savatara Corporation** – legal/financial shell; branded as fiscal presenter/fiscal sponsor for big shows; likely 501(c)(3) or charity-adjacent vehicle.
- **Dance Factory Ridgefield (DFR)** – branded dance school; supplies students/cast, day-to-day tuition revenue.
- **Dennis Sedita** – infrastructure / production support; logistics, heavy lifting, venue/production backbone.
- **Scholarship Program** – “Susan Vallo Memorial Dance Scholarship Program”; used as charitable front for ticket sales & donations around Nutcracker and other shows.

### Factual Spine (What Actually Happens)

#### 1) Work & Dependence (2019–2022)

- You perform continuous, integral work:
  - Instruction, choreography, rehearsal direction.
  - Production planning, costume & prop build, digital backdrops, music editing.
  - Public-facing representation of the studio/brand.
- Paid as 1099, no payroll, no taxes withheld, no benefits.
- Employer controls:
  - Schedules, content (“keep it simple”), attendance, communication channels.
  - Who you can talk to, how you appear online, and how the work is presented.
- **Economic reality:** you are economically dependent on this work and embedded in the business, not a separate enterprise.

#### 2) Dual-Entity Trick (DFR + Savatara + Scholarship)

The forensic text points to a layered system:

1. DFR sells tuition and student participation.
2. Savatara Corporation appears in credits and programs as “Dance Factory Ridgefield and Savatara Corporation Present The Nutcracker” at The Klein, etc.
3. Performances are labeled as benefits for the Susan Vallo Memorial Dance Scholarship Program.
4. That structure allows:
   - Access to non-profit venue rates at The Klein.
   - Ability to solicit tax-deductible donations “for scholarships.”
   - Potential diversion of real revenue (ticket sales, sponsorships) back to the for-profit controllers through “consulting fees,” “production fees,” “rent,” etc.
5. You, the person who built the operational system and much of the repertoire, are pushed out while the vehicle (Savatara + scholarship + DFR pipeline) keeps running.

So: Savatara is the business shell; StagePort/Ballet-Arts lineage is the heritage and technical infrastructure they’re standing on.

#### 3) Ousting the Architect

The notes say this explicitly:

- A “hostile takeover” of the dual structure:
  - You (Structural Architect) and Jillian (Artistic Asset) are ousted.
  - The system—curriculum, structure, goodwill—is retained.
  - While you’re being threatened / financially drained, substitutes and new board members are onboarded using your own documents and lesson plans.

#### 4) Continued Use / Ongoing Admissions (2023–2025)

Later references (search pages, credits) show:

- “Dance Factory Ridgefield and Savatara Corporation Present The Nutcracker” — December 13, 2025, etc.
- Winter Showcase, Illuminate, Glow, Tutu Tuesday promos, all under DFR brand but with Savatara still credited.
- Your older drafts and misclassification statement name Savatara as:
  - “Legal Entity / Financial Conduit.”
  - “501c3-pending / administrative shell.”

This is the through-line: public, timestamped admission that Savatara is still active, still the producer/fiscal presenter, and still leveraging scholarship language as cover.

### Legal Meal – Claims and Theories

#### 1) Wage & Misclassification (CT + NY)

- Misclassification: you’re labeled 1099 but:
  - Work is ongoing and integral.
  - They control how, when, and where you worked.
  - You had no ability to hire subs or set your own rates.
- Claims:
  - Unpaid/underpaid wages 2019–2022.
  - Overtime and minimum wage violations (post-reclassification as employee).
  - Double damages in CT; up to 300% in NY.
- Where drafts fit:
  - CT DOL Wage Claim Sample → CT packet template.
  - NY DOL Misclassification Worker Statement → NY packet template.

#### 2) IP Infringement & Unjust Enrichment

- Your choreography, curriculum, digital systems, and possibly the Nutcracker system itself are original works.
- They continue to use them post-ousting:
  - Same production names, similar casting structures, likely recycled blocking and story logic.
  - Ongoing tagging or references to your lineage in marketing.
- Theory:
  - They obtained your work through coercion and misclassification.
  - They now reap ongoing ticket and tuition revenue from those works without license or credit → unjust enrichment + infringement.

#### 3) Charity / Corporate Fraud (Savatara + Scholarship)

- Savatara as “fiscal presenter” / scholarship steward:
  - Accessing tax-advantaged venue rates & donations.
  - Potentially routing that value back to the for-profit business.
- If Savatara or the scholarship program is 501(c)(3) or held out as charitable:
  - Possible private inurement and charitable fraud issues.
- Your earlier forensic memo’s line about “revenue estimated to exceed $100,000 for a weekend run” at The Klein is perfect context: these aren’t small sums.

#### 4) Spoliation & Evidence Preservation

- One draft is “Plaintiff’s Motion for Sanctions Due to Spoliation of Evidence.”
- Theory:
  - You sent a preservation demand (or will).
  - They failed to preserve Zoom recordings, class footage, routing records, and other control/compensation evidence.
- That motion becomes your hammer later if you end up in litigation—right now it acts as:
  - A template for a preservation letter (step 1).
  - A threat: if they destroy anything after notice, you have a ready-made sanctions brief.

### Evidence Spine (What’s Already on the Table)

Just from the images + prior text, we have:

- Corporate role analysis memos naming Savatara as fiscal presenter & scholarship conduit.
- Genealogy & lineage section (Prati / Van Cura) tying StagePort + heritage to your family, not theirs.
- CT DOL Wage Claim Sample (filled) naming Savatara, Kristin, Dennis, Ridgefield address, 1099, description of claim.
- NY DOL Misclassification Worker Statement outlining:
  - Nature of work.
  - Control level.
  - Integration into business.
  - Economic dependence.
  - Method of payment.
- Search result screenshots showing:
  - “Dance Factory Ridgefield and Savatara Corporation present…” for Nutcracker 2025.
  - Winter Showcase and scholarship language.
- Draft motion for spoliation naming DFR, Savatara, Kristin.

This is plenty to treat as a v1 Exhibit list.

### Monday’s Needles (Concrete 3-Step Plan)

#### Needle 1 – CT DOL Packet Lock-In (Savatara/DFR)

**Goal:** Freeze the wage/misclassification facts in a state system.

- Take the CT DOL Wage Claim Sample.
- Layer in:
  - The neutral narrative drafted earlier.
  - The Savatara/DFR dual-entity description (calm, not accusatory).
- **Output:** _CT DOL Wage Complaint – Savatara v1.pdf_ ready to upload.

#### Needle 2 – NY DOL Worker Statement as Master Fact Sheet

**Goal:** One clean worker statement usable for any forum.

- Use the NY Misclassification Worker Statement as the base.
- Update:
  - Dates → 2019–2022.
  - Method of payment → Zelle/1099; no payroll.
  - Add a short paragraph about Savatara as shell/fiscal presenter and you as continuous operational worker.
- **Output:** _NY Worker Statement v1.docx_ – attachable to NY DOL, lawyers, or future court pleadings.

#### Needle 3 – Preservation Letter re: Savatara + Scholarship + Klein

**Goal:** Put them on formal notice before any more evidence disappears.

- Strip the spoliation motion back into a letter:
  - To: Savatara Corporation, Dance Factory Ridgefield, Kristin Leggio, Dennis Sedita.
- Demand preservation of:
  - All Zoom/online class recordings.
  - All programs, cast lists, and scholarship/donation records for Nutcracker & Winter Showcase.
  - All contracts with The Klein & any fiscal sponsor docs.
- Mention: “This matter involves potential wage/misclassification, IP, and charitable compliance issues.”
- **Output:** _Preservation & Records Demand – Savatara v1_.
