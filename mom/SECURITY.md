# Security Policy

M.O.M. is a privacy-first memory system. Governance is not optional.

## Reporting

If you discover a vulnerability, report it privately to:

- Email: [YOUR-SECURITY@DOMAIN.COM]
- Include: reproduction steps, impact, and whether user data could be exposed.

## Scope

We care especially about:

- Encryption boundary violations
- Consent bypass
- Notification leakage
- Prompt injection paths through integrations
- Supply-chain / dependency tampering
- Data retention violations (storing what must not be stored)
- Audit log forgery or deletion

## Safe harbor

If you act in good faith and avoid unnecessary data access, we will treat your report as a contribution, not a crime novel.
