# Intake Checklist (7-Day Governance Sprint)

## Required

- Repo access OR sandbox branch
- Current “memory” storage approach (db / vector store / files)
- List of proactive behaviors (“nudges”) you want
- Privacy red lines (what must never happen)
- Environments: staging, prod (optional)

## Helpful

- Sample user queries (10–20)
- Sample “bad outcomes” (5–10)
- Current logging/audit approach
- Any compliance constraints (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.)

## Success criteria

- No silent overwrites
- Consent gates enforced
- Nudges are constitutional + rate-limited
- Outputs are citable + explainable
