# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
This project follows semantic versioning and “Coda-style” continuity: no silent rewrites.

## [Unreleased]

- Pending.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- SYSTEM_SPEC_v1.1: data model + invariants (MemNode / Corridors / Coda / StagePort).
- Nudge Constitution v1.0.
- Threat Model v1.0.
- Offer: 7-Day Governance Sprint.

### Notes

- This release is spec-first. Implementation is staged after invariants are staked.
