# Models Directory

This directory contains models and configurations. Use encryption to secure intellectual property and sensitive data.

## Suggested Actions
1. Encrypt sensitive model files using AES.
2. Keep encryption keys secured (use `.env` files or secret management tools).
3. Follow the `encryption_layer_setup.txt` in the root for guidance.
