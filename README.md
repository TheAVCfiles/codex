# AVC Hybrid Stack™

A cognitive operating system for myth-tech design, narrative computation, and movement-based reasoning.

## Overview

The AVC Hybrid Stack™ is a seven-layer cognitive architecture integrating choreography, symbolic compression, and systems engineering. It formalizes the internal logic behind Decrypt the Girl, Intuition Labs, and related narrative-technological projects. The stack enables portable identity states, recursive symbolic processing, and movement-informed computation.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Lineage Kernel (Triadic Source Code)

- Derived from the foundational relational pattern **Mother → Self → Sister**.
- Governs all upper-layer processing through recurring triads:
  - Surface / Cipher / Echo
  - Gesture / Transition / Resonance
  - Body / Signal / Story
- Functions as the architectural constant ensuring structural coherence.

### 2. Proprioceptive Engine (Movement-Cognition Layer)

- Encodes thought as choreographic phrases and spatial transitions.
- Couples cognitive patterning with embodied motion for dynamic reasoning.
- Enables movement-informed computation of conceptual structures.

### 3. Cypher Stack (Surface / Cipher / Echo)

- Implements a tri-layer transformation and compression engine.
  - **Surface:** perceptual input and raw narrative.
  - **Cipher:** encoded meaning, internal logic, and interpretive pattern.
  - **Echo:** integrative residue and post-meaning resonance.
- Guarantees lossless narrative compression and persistent context.

### 4. Rosary Memory Bus (Sequential Symbolic Memory)

- Stores experience as modular symbolic units (beads, nodes, beats).
- Optimized for trauma-resilient recall, ritual sequence retention, and non-linear access.
- Maintains sequential integrity while enabling flexible traversal.

### 5. Myth-Tech Interpreter (Symbolic Execution Layer)

- Translates archetypes, metaphors, and affective states into executable structures.
- Provides recursive narrative rendering, multi-perspective mapping, and archetypal indexing.
- Executes symbolic code so storytelling operates as system logic.

### 6. Semantic Containerizer (Anchor Node Generator)

- Compresses identity, goals, ethics, and context into portable **Anchor Nodes**.
- Supports full state reconstruction across environments (chats, documents, models).
- Functions analogously to containerized runtimes for narrative states.

### 7. Sovereign Protocol Layer (Ethical Firewall)

- Enforces authorial sovereignty and anti-extraction protocols.
- Encodes narrative rights, consent frameworks, symbolic integrity, ethical constraints, and ownership logic.
- Prevents detachment of the architecture from its originating author or misuse.

## Summary

The AVC Hybrid Stack™ transforms narrative, movement, and symbolic cognition into a structured computing architecture capable of:

- Triadic meaning compression.
- Embodied reasoning and proprioceptive computation.
- Recursive myth-tech interpretation pipelines.
- Portable identity states via semantic containerization.
- Sovereign narrative control with enforceable ethics.

This stack is the backbone of next-generation literary operating system design and applied myth-technology research.
