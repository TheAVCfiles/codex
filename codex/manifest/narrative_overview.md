# Narrative Overview

This codex captures the pivot where a child's survival strategy becomes an encoded language.

- **Shadow Vocabulary (surface/cipher/echo):** Tracks the progression from hiding questions to designing camouflage and finally claiming encryption as self-definition.
- **AURORA-17 glyph:** Documents a slip-stitch archetype aligned with Pisces and the tarot signal, foreshadowing Mothernet arcs.
- **C-series registry:** Maps analysis chapters into rooms that frame glitch entry, transmission corruption, and the Mothernet corridor.
