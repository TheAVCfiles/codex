# EVIDENCE_INDEX_ZIPLOQ_KLS_2021-12-06

**Matter:** Unpaid labor + unlicensed operational use of authored curriculum/choreography (implementation by third party; narrative inversion; value capture).  
**Counterparty:** “Kristin Leggio Sedita” (iMessage thread labeled “Maybe: Kristin Leggio Sedita”).  
**Date range shown:** Dec 6, 2021 (timestamps visible in thread).

## E-001 — iMessage thread screenshot (Dec 6, 2021 @ 12:32 PM visible)

**File:** `IMG_8C4E51F8-B273-4324-8A1C-F6AA22D51916.jpeg`  
**What it shows:** Multiple creative/production files shared (“Videoleap…” videos, “RenderedImage.jpg”), then sender (AVC) stating: “This version is better i think” and describing logistical emergency + panic while still trying to meet rehearsal obligations (“packed car… do rehearsal… drill the lock off now… panicking”).  
**What it proves:**

- Ongoing active contribution to production assets (video edits / visuals) tied to studio/program operations.
- The labor is occurring alongside crisis-level logistics, consistent with overextension / “swamped” working conditions.

**Why it matters:** Establishes timing, active involvement, and pressure context consistent with uncompensated/undercompensated load.

## E-002 — iMessage rehearsal coverage negotiation + replacement (same thread)

**File:** `IMG_2EEACB72-B885-4C7E-97F7-25E50A4BD201.jpeg`  
**What it shows:** After AVC describes emergency logistics, Kristin replies with scheduling/coverage details: “I have Priya and Sophia coming… and Mika for you… if you can’t get back… I’ll deal w it… You’re good.” AVC offers: “Do you want me to maybe FaceTime with her and do it virtually?” Kristin: “I got her we’re 👍”  
**What it proves:**

- Kristin is running rehearsals/students in a way that substitutes for AVC’s intended paid role (“I got her”).
- The work continues even when AVC cannot physically attend (coverage substitution).

**Why it matters:** Shows work execution/coverage occurring in AVC’s absence, which supports the “they ran the system without paying the author” pattern.

## E-003 — iMessage detailed choreography/curriculum adjustments implemented by Kristin

**File:** `IMG_BFC7B627-C2AC-44D0-A9D9-FD5BBE584026.jpeg`  
**What it shows:** Kristin describing technical corrections and sequence changes: “fixed her arms… worked on her 2 trouble spots (arabesque to passe… pique passe)… changed the omuates to burras before the turn sequence…” plus attached media/file transfers.  
**What it proves:**

- Kristin is implementing curriculum/choreography-level decisions (specific technical and sequence edits).
- These are not “admin tasks”—they’re instructional IP execution and program delivery.

**Why it matters:** Supports claim of operational use of authored pedagogy/choreographic framework (derivative teaching and execution), which is the foundation for licensing/value claims.

## E-004 — iMessage request for AVC to run rehearsal (assignment of labor)

**File:** `IMG_E051C905-30D0-495A-9281-6B7EC5F969CC.jpeg`  
**What it shows:** Kristin: “watch Rory — can you come to run sugar at like 745? If not… I can rehearse her.” AVC: “Yes absolutely I’ll be there.”  
**What it proves:**

- AVC is being scheduled as the labor provider for rehearsal delivery.
- Kristin frames rehearsal delivery as interchangeable coverage (“if not… I can rehearse her”), implying program continuity does not depend on AVC’s compensated role.

**Why it matters:** Establishes expectation of AVC labor and also ability/willingness to substitute (key for misclassification/extraction: they treat authored work as house-operational).

## E-005 — iMessage showing studio customer intake + class placement decision-making

**File:** `IMG_018BE5F8-1717-418E-AF91-D07ECB172067.jpeg`  
**What it shows:** Kristin: “You’re gonna have a new 4 yr old girl try this Saturday… may also have a boy… told the mom the combo class might be a little ‘old’ for him…” plus feedback about AVC’s timing/edit work: “you times it perfectly / Timed.”  
**What it proves:**

- Kristin is running business operations (new student intake, class placement) while AVC is producing creative assets and being pulled into delivery.
- Confirms AVC’s technical contribution (“timed”) is recognized as part of product output.

**Why it matters:** Supports the split: Kristin captures operations + revenue, AVC provides specialized value that is treated as support rather than compensated architecture/IP.

## E-006 — iMessage showing personal harm/overextension while work continues

**File:** `IMG_BFC7B627-C2AC-44D0-A9D9-FD5BBE584026.jpeg` (lower portion)  
**What it shows:** AVC: “Meanwhile, my fuckin night lol / Zach’s hands are bleeding / We are just leaving.” Kristin: “Holy shit!!!!”  
**What it proves:**

- Documented strain/incident occurring in parallel with ongoing work delivery context.

**Why it matters:** Corroborates the “running bleeding” claim as contemporaneous, not retrospective.

## Next evidence to collect (high value)

1. Any message where Kristin references your program by name or “your curriculum” explicitly.
2. Any message where money is referenced: pay amount, “profit,” “revenue,” “studio numbers,” “your program brings in \_\_\_\_.”
3. Any document/video where your choreography/curriculum appears as the default studio offering (schedule, marketing, parent emails, recital materials).
4. Any agreement/offer text showing you were paid as a contractor/teacher while your program operated as infrastructure.
